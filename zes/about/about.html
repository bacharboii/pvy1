        <p>
            Padoru is a "squad" of laid back, mostly casual people who like to play video games with friends. Some players come and go, others stick around. While most of us like to play MMO RPG games, such as Tera, Albion Online or BDO, we also play shooters, strategic games or even sandbox games.
        </p>
    
        <p>Formalities aside, in the words of the clan founder Isaac "DogTreats" Yeung, we will mold you into a living meme, leaving no aspect missing in no time. We will flame you until you get good enough to flame others.</p>

            <em>History</em>
        </h2>

        <hr>

        <p>
          The clan was founded in the year 2015 by 3 friends, mainly playing the MMO RPG game Tera. As more players joined their path, they continued to climb the ranks of Tera's worldwide leaderboards. Over time meeting many friends, the passion for the game started to die out, and so they ventured into different paths.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(70, 70, 70); font-size: 55px;">
          <em>2018 :</em>
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>The clan has gained many new members as of the release of Monster Hunter: World. Recruitment was easy, and most of the new players stuck around. Some more active than others, although all contributed something.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(70, 70, 70); font-size: 55px;">
          <em>2019 :</em>
        </h2>

        <hr>

        <p>The clan continued with new members, friends and games to try out. Tom clancy's: The division 2 came out in the early 2019 and was a rather good game. As with any game, the ingame clan was made, and new friends were made. Some time has passed, and in April the game Albion Online went free to play. Although the game span was no longer than a month.</p>
